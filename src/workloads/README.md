# Workloads

This folder contains shell scripts to generate synthetic workloads.

- **cpu.sh** – CPU-intensive tasks.
- **io.sh** – IO-bound tasks.
- **batch.sh** – Batch-style tasks.
- **real_time.sh** – Real-time task patterns.
- **stress.sh** – Stress/mixed workloads.
- **mixed_realistic.sh** – Hybrid workload approximating real-world usage.

Each script generates a workload trace that can be fed into the simulators.
